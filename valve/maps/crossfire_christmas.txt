Crossfire Christmas by SilentRunner007

Dec. 2023/Jan. 2024
=======================================================


Just me giving the well known Crossfire map by Dario Casali
my own little Christmas spin.
It's been done a million times but what the heck why not once more lol

This was made from a rmf I found on MODDB
because I have no desire to build it from scratch ;)

Sounds from the web except for 3dm_bik_ball...Thats is from cs_bikini by 3D-Mike

Textures are default, Some customs I found online, couple "borrowed" I believe from Creepitall and Nipper

Models Not sure original sources except for xmasrat which I think was made by Quicksilver


The "secret blue room" is not a secret now and it is not blue.
As much as I wanted to remove the egons I left them in.
The "nuke" still is there...sorta. Hit the button and see what happens(Some point it may lag but I wanted something specific to happen).

Happy Holidays
