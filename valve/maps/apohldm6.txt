Installation
------------

Unzip the file apohldm6.bsp into your ...\sierra\halflife\valve\maps directory


2 Playing Tips
--------------

(1) Using the Gauss-Gun to shoot through walls: This can help you very often in this maps.For example,if you
    here someone climbing up a ladder and than picking up a new gun,you can guess that he just got the Gauss-
    Gun himself and so you can aim to the wall where the Gauss lies behind and shoot and voila! You got him!
(2) Where is the other one?: It's important to know where your opponent(s) is/are,so it's important to keep 
    your ears open.If you hear when someone climbs up/down a ladder or someone puts up the snarks you can guess
    where he is.
    Also the laserpoint of the RPG can tell you the position of your opponent....so learn to deactivate your own 
    one when you walk around.


Info
----

This map is intented to be for one-on-one or small 3player-ffa matches.

It's meant to be some kind of sequel for one of my other maps 
(APOHLDM5 - En Garde) and also my next map will be in the same style
(will be APOHLDM7 - Touche).
You see the names? En Garde | Riposte | Touche ! Cool,eh? :)
