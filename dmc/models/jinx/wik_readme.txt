these gargoyles were used in the 'wikked' AHL maps, which were later open-sourced. they are for use in Action HL maps ONLY. you may NOT use these gargoyles in a map for any other mod without permission!

"Firestarter" did the models. (http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/hellhole/)

**** I got permission from Firestarter (the modeler) to use these outside of AHL, but I could not get a hold of Rawhyde- I got no response from my email. I'm a little queasy about using them because of that. However, this map also has a great Action HL version, and Firestarter said it was okay, so I'm going ahead and including them. I wouldn't use these in other HLDM or VS maps, though, without similarly going after permission from these guys or also doing a version for Action HL as well.


Here is the documentation that goes with the open-sourced 'wikked' maps:
